# Build your own playlist.
# Building a playlist is easy. Itâ€™s just a regular text file (no YAML required, even)
# What makes it a playlist? Well, you have to give the file the .m3u extension, like playlist.m3u or something.
#  Use your shuffle method to mix up your playlist.

# My custom shuffle method
