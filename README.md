Exercises from Launchschool's book "Introduction to Programming with Ruby" and Christopher Pine's "Learn to Program"

These exercises are organized in three main folders: 
- "learn_to_program" for the exercises from "Introduction to Programming with Ruby"
- "preparatory_course" for the exercises from "Learn to Program"
- "Pear and Bacon Grilled Cheese" contains a project from the "Front End Prep" section

Both these folders contain several sub-folders corresponding to the book chapters and containing one or more ruby files.

Generally, every ruby file in each folder corresponds to an exercise, even though in some cases I decided to make two or more exercises in the same file.
