# Exercise 5
# In the first program x = 3
# In the second program you get an error "undefined local variable or method",
# because x is not available outside the do/end block of times method.

# Exercise 6
# It tells me that the program is trying to call a variable called shoes,
# that either has not already been defined in the program or has been defined
# outside the scope in which the variable is called.
